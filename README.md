## Analytics for All: Analytics Process Automation with Alteryx Designer
A hands-on workshop to dive into development on Alteryx's Designer platform

## Overview
Enterprises can innovate faster, drive business-process efficiency, and accelerate digital transformation with Alteryx. Alteryx Designer empowers data analysts, scientists and knowledge workers alike by combining data preparation, data blending, and analytics —predictive, statistical, or spatial —using a low code to no-code intuitive user interface.

This workshop will focus on the following solution capabilities within Alteryx:  
- Alteryx Designer delivers best in class data prep & analytics: In this workshop we will learn how to master your data landscape, no matter the source. We will connect, blend, and wrangle data from multiple sources. Profile it for sound analytics decisions. No code required.
- Alteryx Designer delivers best in class analytics automation: In this workshop we will learn how to create and automate workflows to accelerate innovation. We will discover the analytics and data science platform that empowers everyone to make breakthrough insights.

## Introducing the Alteryx Designer Interface

All tools in Alteryx appear at the top in the **Tool Palette**. They are divided into different tool categries based on their general functions.

Below the tool palette, you are presented with a blank **Canvas**. This is where you build your workflow to transform and analyze your data using sets of tools:

The **Configuration  window** displays the configurations available for a selected tool or connection in the workflow, or for the workflow itself when nothing is selected.

The **Results window** displays the state of the data as it flows through each tool when a workflow is run. It also shows any messages or errors that occur, as well as links to output files that are created.

## About The Use-Case

In our hands on workshop today, we are going to work on a use-case for ACME Industires, a hypotherical retail company, with stores located in Coloardo.

ACME Industries has ‘dirty’ flat files containing 1) sales data by store and 2) geographical information for each store. We will use Designer to: 
 -  Prepare the data based on conversations with management
 -  Combine the files,
 -  Calculate a ‘Total Sales’ field per store,
 - Calculate the total sales per region (county)
 - Output the top three counties for total sales. 
 - Automate your workflow

At the end of our build, we will have a completed workflow that looks similar to this below:
